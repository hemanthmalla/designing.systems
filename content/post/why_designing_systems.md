Most software generally comprises of multiple components that work together to form a powerful system. Each Component is designed to do one thing very well. Like an orchestra, it is very gratifying to see the execution and capabilities of well engineered systems. As the saying goes..

I throughly enjoy building smart and scalable systems. This blog will document my journey of learning to design better systems, especially ones that are distributed in nature. I've been heavily inspired by [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) to blog about things I learn. If you're not already subscribed to her blog. You should. She is amazing.
