      <description>figcaption { margin-left:30%; } .layers { margin-left:20%; }    Applications deployed on production are expected to possess the following properties :
 Consistency / Reproducibility: Code deployed in a specific environment with a set of dependencies should always result in a deterministic output. Isolation: Applications should always be guaranteed of the resources it needs. We don’t want a noisy neighbour eating into our application&amp;rsquo;s resources. Transparency: There should be provisions in the system to track who’s doing what easily.</description>

      <description>.twitter-tweet-rendered { display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; }  Most software generally comprises of multiple components that work together to form a powerful system. Each Component is designed to do one thing very well. Like an orchestra, it is very gratifying to see the execution and capabilities of well engineered systems. As the saying goes..
 Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic - Arthur C. Clarke
 I throughly enjoy building smart and scalable systems.</description>
